    <p>The Entry of James VI into Edinburgh was a ceremony marking the coming of age of James VI of Scotland as an adult ruler on Friday 19 October 1579. The 13-year old king came to Edinburgh to begin his adult rule, having spent his childhood at Stirling Castle.
His entry to the town was marked by a ceremonial Royal entry, the usual way across Europe of marking a new monarch, or one making his first visit to a city.
Events
According to David Moysie, James VI left Stirling on 29 September 1579 despite a storm. He had lunch at Dunipace and dinner at Linlithgow Palace where he stayed the night, and came to Holyroodhouse the next evening. The town lined the road with men in armour and a salute was fired from Edinburgh Castle.[1]
James arrived from Dalkeith Palace. The processional route went from the West Port, to the Overbow, to the Tolbooth, to St Giles Kirk, the Mercat Cross, the Salt Tron, the Nether Bow, Canongate Cross, and Holyrood Palace.[2] The gates of the town, the tolbooths of Edinburgh and the Canongate, and other buildings were painted white with limewash, called "calk".[3] Householders along the route were asked to hang the external stairs with tapestry and "Arras works".[4]
At the West Port the king was met by 32 burgesses of Edinburgh, whose names are recorded,[5] who carried a canopy made of purple velvet. John Shairp gave a speech in Latin.[6] There was a tableau vivant of the Judgement of Solomon. At the Overbow Cupid gave James the keys to the town. Cupid was played by a boy who descended in a globe. At the Tolbooth four maidens (probably played by boys) represented Peace, Justice, Plenty and Policy, a scene relating to the four Cardinal Virtues. At St Giles, Dame Religion invited the king to hear a sermon on the duty of kings and Psalm 21 was sung. Afterwards, at the Mercat Cross Bacchus shared out wine. At the Salt Tron the genealogy of the Scottish monarchy was presented, perhaps using portraits. The king's horoscope was described by an actor playing Ptolemy at the Netherbow Port. At the Canongate Cross a scene represented the abolition of the Pope's authority in Scotland.[7]

At Holyrood Palace a new lodging was prepared for the king's favourite Esmé Stewart next to the royal apartment.[8] A course or tournament ground made of sand for "running at the ring" was laid at Holyroodhouse.[9] Celebrations continued at Dalkeith Palace, hosted by the former Regent Morton.[10]</p>

At Holyrood Palace a new lodging was prepared for the king's favourite Esmé Stewart next to the royal apartment.[8] A course or tournament ground made of sand for "running at the ring" was laid at Holyroodhouse.[9] Celebrations continued at Dalkeith Palace, hosted by the former Regent Morton.[10]</p>

<p>The Entry of James VI into Edinburgh was a ceremony marking the coming of age of James VI of Scotland as an adult ruler on Friday 19 October 1579. The 13-year old king came to Edinburgh to begin his adult rule, having spent his childhood at Stirling Castle.
His entry to the town was marked by a ceremonial Royal entry, the usual way across Europe of marking a new monarch, or one making his first visit to a city.
Events
According to David Moysie, James VI left Stirling on 29 September 1579 despite a storm. He had lunch at Dunipace and dinner at Linlithgow Palace where he stayed the night, and came to Holyroodhouse the next evening. The town lined the road with men in armour and a salute was fired from Edinburgh Castle.[1]
James arrived from Dalkeith Palace. The processional route went from the West Port, to the Overbow, to the Tolbooth, to St Giles Kirk, the Mercat Cross, the Salt Tron, the Nether Bow, Canongate Cross, and Holyrood Palace.[2] The gates of the town, the tolbooths of Edinburgh and the Canongate, and other buildings were painted white with limewash, called "calk".[3] Householders along the route were asked to hang the external stairs with tapestry and "Arras works".[4]
At the West Port the king was met by 32 burgesses of Edinburgh, whose names are recorded,[5] who carried a canopy made of purple velvet. John Shairp gave a speech in Latin.[6] There was a tableau vivant of the Judgement of Solomon. At the Overbow Cupid gave James the keys to the town. Cupid was played by a boy who descended in a globe. At the Tolbooth four maidens (probably played by boys) represented Peace, Justice, Plenty and Policy, a scene relating to the four Cardinal Virtues. At St Giles, Dame Religion invited the king to hear a sermon on the duty of kings and Psalm 21 was sung. Afterwards, at the Mercat Cross Bacchus shared out wine.

The processional route went from the West Port, to the Overbow, to the Tolbooth, to St Giles Kirk, the Mercat Cross, the Salt Tron, the Nether Bow, Canongate Cross, and Holyrood Palace.[2] The gates of the town, the tolbooths of Edinburgh and the Canongate, and other buildings were painted white with limewash, called "calk".[3] Householders along the route were asked to hang the external stairs with tapestry and "Arras works".[4]
At the West Port the king was met by 32 burgesses of Edinburgh, whose names are recorded,[5] who carried a canopy made of purple velvet. John Shairp gave a speech in Latin.[6] There was a tableau vivant of the Judgement of Solomon. At the Overbow Cupid gave James the keys to the town. Cupid was played by a boy who descended in a globe. At the Tolbooth four maidens (probably played by boys) represented Peace, Justice, Plenty and Policy, a scene relating to the four Cardinal Virtues. At St Giles, Dame Religion invited the king to hear a sermon on the duty of kings and Psalm 21 was sung. Afterwards, at the Mercat Cross Bacchus shared out wine. At the Salt Tron the genealogy of the Scottish monarchy was presented, perhaps using portraits. The king's horoscope was described by an actor playing Ptolemy at the Netherbow Port. At the Canongate Cross a scene represented the abolition of the Pope's authority in Scotland.[7]

At Holyrood Palace a new lodging was prepared for the king's favourite Esmé Stewart next to the royal apartment.[8] A course or tournament ground made of sand for "running at the ring" was laid at Holyroodhouse.[9] Celebrations continued at Dalkeith Palace, hosted by the former Regent Morton.[10]</p>


<p>The Entry of James VI into Edinburgh was a ceremony marking the coming of age of James VI of Scotland as an adult ruler on Friday 19 October 1579. The 13-year old king came to Edinburgh to begin his adult rule, having spent his childhood at Stirling Castle.
His entry to the town was marked by a ceremonial Royal entry, the usual way across Europe of marking a new monarch, or one making his first visit to a city.
Events
According to David Moysie, James VI left Stirling on 29 September 1579 despite a storm. He had lunch at Dunipace and dinner at Linlithgow Palace where he stayed the night, and came to Holyroodhouse the next evening. The town lined the road with men in armour and a salute was fired from Edinburgh Castle.[1]

<p>The Entry of James VI into Edinburgh was a ceremony marking the coming of age of James VI of Scotland as an adult ruler on Friday 19 October 1579. The 13-year old king came to Edinburgh to begin his adult rule, having spent his childhood at Stirling Castle.
His entry to the town was marked by a ceremonial Royal entry, the usual way across Europe of marking a new monarch, or one making his first visit to a city.
Events
According to David Moysie, James VI left Stirling on 29 September 1579 despite a storm. He had lunch at Dunipace and dinner at Linlithgow Palace where he stayed the night, and came to Holyroodhouse the next evening. The town lined the road with men in armour and a salute was fired from Edinburgh Castle.[1]
James arrived from Dalkeith Palace. The processional route went from the West Port, to the Overbow, to the Tolbooth, to St Giles Kirk, the Mercat Cross, the Salt Tron, the Nether Bow, Canongate Cross, and Holyrood Palace.[2] The gates of the town, the tolbooths of Edinburgh and the Canongate, and other buildings were painted white with limewash, called "calk".[3] Householders along the route were asked to hang the external stairs with tapestry and "Arras works".[4]
At the West Port the king was met by 32 burgesses of Edinburgh, whose names are recorded,[5] who carried a canopy made of purple velvet. John Shairp gave a speech in Latin.[6] There was a tableau vivant of the Judgement of Solomon. At the Overbow Cupid gave James the keys to the town. Cupid was played by a boy who descended in a globe. At the Tolbooth four maidens (probably played by boys) represented Peace, Justice, Plenty and Policy, a scene relating to the four Cardinal Virtues. At St Giles, Dame Religion invited the king to hear a sermon on the duty of kings and Psalm 21 was sung. Afterwards, at the Mercat Cross Bacchus shared out wine. At the Salt Tron the genealogy of the Scottish monarchy was presented, perhaps using portraits. The king's horoscope was described by an actor playing Ptolemy at the Netherbow Port. At the Canongate Cross a scene represented the abolition of the Pope's authority in Scotland.[7]

At Holyrood Palace a new lodging was prepared for the king's favourite Esmé Stewart next to the royal apartment.[8] A course or tournament ground made of sand for "running at the ring" was laid at Holyroodhouse.[9] Celebrations continued at Dalkeith Palace, hosted by the former Regent Morton.[10]</p>

John Shairp gave a speech in Latin.[6] There was a tableau vivant of the Judgement of Solomon. At the Overbow Cupid gave James the keys to the town. Cupid was played by a boy who descended in a globe. At the Tolbooth four maidens (probably played by boys) represented Peace, Justice, Plenty and Policy, a scene relating to the four Cardinal Virtues. At St Giles, Dame Religion invited the king to hear a sermon on the duty of kings and Psalm 21 was sung. Afterwards, at the Mercat Cross Bacchus shared out wine. At the Salt Tron the genealogy of the Scottish monarchy was presented, perhaps using portraits. The king's horoscope was described by an actor playing Ptolemy at the Netherbow Port. At the Canongate Cross a scene represented the abolition of the Pope's authority in Scotland.[7]

At Holyrood Palace a new lodging was prepared for the king's favourite Esmé Stewart next to the royal apartment.[8] A course or tournament ground made of sand for "running at the ring" was laid at Holyroodhouse.[9] Celebrations continued at Dalkeith Palace, hosted by the former Regent Morton.[10]</p>

<p>The Entry of James VI into Edinburgh was a ceremony marking the coming of age of James VI of Scotland as an adult ruler on Friday 19 October 1579. The 13-year old king came to Edinburgh to begin his adult rule, having spent his childhood at Stirling Castle.
His entry to the town was marked by a ceremonial Royal entry, the usual way across Europe of marking a new monarch, or one making his first visit to a city.
Events
According to David Moysie, James VI left Stirling on 29 September 1579 despite a storm. He had lunch at Dunipace and dinner at Linlithgow Palace where he stayed the night, and came to Holyroodhouse the next evening. The town lined the road with men in armour and a salute was fired from Edinburgh Castle.[1]

<p>The Entry of James VI into Edinburgh was a ceremony marking the coming of age of James VI of Scotland as an adult ruler on Friday 19 October 1579. The 13-year old king came to Edinburgh to begin his adult rule, having spent his childhood at Stirling Castle.
His entry to the town was marked by a ceremonial Royal entry, the usual way across Europe of marking a new monarch, or one making his first visit to a city.
Events
According to David Moysie, James VI left Stirling on 29 September 1579 despite a storm. He had lunch at Dunipace and dinner at Linlithgow Palace where he stayed the night, and came to Holyroodhouse the next evening. The town lined the road with men in armour and a salute was fired from Edinburgh Castle.[1]
James arrived from Dalkeith Palace. The processional route went from the West Port, to the Overbow, to the Tolbooth, to St Giles Kirk, the Mercat Cross, the Salt Tron, the Nether Bow, Canongate Cross, and Holyrood Palace.[2] The gates of the town, the tolbooths of Edinburgh and the Canongate, and other buildings were painted white with limewash, called "calk".[3] Householders along the route were asked to hang the external stairs with tapestry and "Arras works".[4]
At the West Port the king was met by 32 burgesses of Edinburgh, whose names are recorded,[5] who carried a canopy made of purple velvet. John Shairp gave a speech in Latin.[6] There was a tableau vivant of the Judgement of Solomon. At the Overbow Cupid gave James the keys to the town. Cupid was played by a boy who descended in a globe. At the Tolbooth four maidens (probably played by boys) represented Peace, Justice, Plenty and Policy, a scene relating to the four Cardinal Virtues. At St Giles, Dame Religion invited the king to hear a sermon on the duty of kings and Psalm 21 was sung. Afterwards, at the Mercat Cross Bacchus shared out wine. At the Salt Tron the genealogy of the Scottish monarchy was presented, perhaps using portraits. The king's horoscope was described by an actor playing Ptolemy at the Netherbow Port. At the Canongate Cross a scene represented the abolition of the Pope's authority in Scotland.[7]

At Holyrood Palace a new lodging was prepared for the king's favourite Esmé Stewart next to the royal apartment.[8] A course or tournament ground made of sand for "running at the ring" was laid at Holyroodhouse.[9] Celebrations continued at Dalkeith Palace, hosted by the former Regent Morton.[10]</p>

John Shairp gave a speech in Latin.[6] There was a tableau vivant of the Judgement of Solomon. At the Overbow Cupid gave James the keys to the town. Cupid was played by a boy who descended in a globe. At the Tolbooth four maidens (probably played by boys) represented Peace, Justice, Plenty and Policy, a scene relating to the four Cardinal Virtues. At St Giles, Dame Religion invited the king to hear a sermon on the duty of kings and Psalm 21 was sung. Afterwards, at the Mercat Cross Bacchus shared out wine. At the Salt Tron the genealogy of the Scottish monarchy was presented, perhaps using portraits. The king's horoscope was described by an actor playing Ptolemy at the Netherbow Port. At the Canongate Cross a scene represented the abolition of the Pope's authority in Scotland.[7]

At Holyrood Palace a new lodging was prepared for the king's favourite Esmé Stewart next to the royal apartment.[8] A course or tournament ground made of sand for "running at the ring" was laid at Holyroodhouse.[9] Celebrations continued at Dalkeith Palace, hosted by the former Regent Morton.[10]</p>
<p>The Entry of James VI into Edinburgh was a ceremony marking the coming of age of James VI of Scotland as an adult ruler on Friday 19 October 1579. The 13-year old king came to Edinburgh to begin his adult rule, having spent his childhood at Stirling Castle.
His entry to the town was marked by a ceremonial Royal entry, the usual way across Europe of marking a new monarch, or one making his first visit to a city.
Events
According to David Moysie, James VI left Stirling on 29 September 1579 despite a storm. He had lunch at Dunipace and dinner at Linlithgow Palace where he stayed the night, and came to Holyroodhouse the next evening. The town lined the road with men in armour and a salute was fired from Edinburgh Castle.[1]

<p>The Entry of James VI into Edinburgh was a ceremony marking the coming of age of James VI of Scotland as an adult ruler on Friday 19 October 1579. The 13-year old king came to Edinburgh to begin his adult rule, having spent his childhood at Stirling Castle.
His entry to the town was marked by a ceremonial Royal entry, the usual way across Europe of marking a new monarch, or one making his first visit to a city.
Events
According to David Moysie, James VI left Stirling on 29 September 1579 despite a storm. He had lunch at Dunipace and dinner at Linlithgow Palace where he stayed the night, and came to Holyroodhouse the next evening. The town lined the road with men in armour and a salute was fired from Edinburgh Castle.[1]
James arrived from Dalkeith Palace. The processional route went from the West Port, to the Overbow, to the Tolbooth, to St Giles Kirk, the Mercat Cross, the Salt Tron, the Nether Bow, Canongate Cross, and Holyrood Palace.[2] The gates of the town, the tolbooths of Edinburgh and the Canongate, and other buildings were painted white with limewash, called "calk".[3] Householders along the route were asked to hang the external stairs with tapestry and "Arras works".[4]
At the West Port the king was met by 32 burgesses of Edinburgh, whose names are recorded,[5] who carried a canopy made of purple velvet. John Shairp gave a speech in Latin.[6] There was a tableau vivant of the Judgement of Solomon. At the Overbow Cupid gave James the keys to the town. Cupid was played by a boy who descended in a globe. At the Tolbooth four maidens (probably played by boys) represented Peace, Justice, Plenty and Policy, a scene relating to the four Cardinal Virtues. At St Giles, Dame Religion invited the king to hear a sermon on the duty of kings and Psalm 21 was sung. Afterwards, at the Mercat Cross Bacchus shared out wine. At the Salt Tron the genealogy of the Scottish monarchy was presented, perhaps using portraits. The king's horoscope was described by an actor playing Ptolemy at the Netherbow Port. At the Canongate Cross a scene represented the abolition of the Pope's authority in Scotland.[7]

At Holyrood Palace a new lodging was prepared for the king's favourite Esmé Stewart next to the royal apartment.[8] A course or tournament ground made of sand for "running at the ring" was laid at Holyroodhouse.[9] Celebrations continued at Dalkeith Palace, hosted by the former Regent Morton.[10]</p>

John Shairp gave a speech in Latin.[6] There was a tableau vivant of the Judgement of Solomon. At the Overbow Cupid gave James the keys to the town. Cupid was played by a boy who descended in a globe. At the Tolbooth four maidens (probably played by boys) represented Peace, Justice, Plenty and Policy, a scene relating to the four Cardinal Virtues. At St Giles, Dame Religion invited the king to hear a sermon on the duty of kings and Psalm 21 was sung. Afterwards, at the Mercat Cross Bacchus shared out wine. At the Salt Tron the genealogy of the Scottish monarchy was presented, perhaps using portraits. The king's horoscope was described by an actor playing Ptolemy at the Netherbow Port. At the Canongate Cross a scene represented the abolition of the Pope's authority in Scotland.[7]

At Holyrood Palace a new lodging was prepared for the king's favourite Esmé Stewart next to the royal apartment.[8] A course or tournament ground made of sand for "running at the ring" was laid at Holyroodhouse.[9] Celebrations continued at Dalkeith Palace, hosted by the former Regent Morton.[10]</p>

<p>The Entry of James VI into Edinburgh was a ceremony marking the coming of age of James VI of Scotland as an adult ruler on Friday 19 October 1579. The 13-year old king came to Edinburgh to begin his adult rule, having spent his childhood at Stirling Castle.
His entry to the town was marked by a ceremonial Royal entry, the usual way across Europe of marking a new monarch, or one making his first visit to a city.
Events
According to David Moysie, James VI left Stirling on 29 September 1579 despite a storm. He had lunch at Dunipace and dinner at Linlithgow Palace where he stayed the night, and came to Holyroodhouse the next evening. The town lined the road with men in armour and a salute was fired from Edinburgh Castle.[1]
James arrived from Dalkeith Palace. The processional route went from the West Port, to the Overbow, to the Tolbooth, to St Giles Kirk, the Mercat Cross, the Salt Tron, the Nether Bow, Canongate Cross, and Holyrood Palace.[2] The gates of the town, the tolbooths of Edinburgh and the Canongate, and other buildings were painted white with limewash, called "calk".[3] Householders along the route were asked to hang the external stairs with tapestry and "Arras works".[4]
